## Purpose & Use

This GitHub organization supports Decision Support work across City Colleges of Chicago by providing a shared space to organize, review, and maintain analytical code.

It is used to:

- Validate code through peer review before results are shared
- Organize SQL and analysis code so it is easy to find, understand, and reuse
- Apply consistent documentation standards
- Support collaboration across college-level teams and the District Office
- Track changes over time to support transparency, reproducibility, and accountability

This structure helps ensure that Decision Support analyses are accurate, consistent, and reliable, while reducing duplicated effort and preserving institutional knowledge.
